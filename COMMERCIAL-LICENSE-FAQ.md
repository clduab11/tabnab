# Commercial License FAQ

## General Questions

### What is TabNab's licensing model?

TabNab uses a dual-license model:
- **PolyForm Shield License 1.0.0** for personal and non-commercial use (free)
- **Commercial License** for any profit-generating or business use (paid)

### Why did you choose this licensing model?

We want TabNab to be freely available for personal use, learning, and open-source projects, while ensuring that commercial users who derive business value from TabNab contribute to its ongoing development and maintenance.

### Can I try TabNab before purchasing a commercial license?

Yes! You can use TabNab for evaluation and testing purposes under the PolyForm Shield License at no cost. This allows you to fully evaluate TabNab before making a purchasing decision.

## Commercial vs. Non-Commercial Use

### Do I need a commercial license if...

#### ...I use TabNab for my personal projects?
**No.** Personal projects are covered by the free PolyForm Shield License.

#### ...I use TabNab to learn browser automation?
**No.** Educational and learning purposes are covered by the free license.

#### ...I work for a company and want to automate internal processes?
**Yes.** Internal business use by a for-profit organization requires a commercial license.

#### ...I'm building a SaaS product that uses TabNab?
**Yes.** Any commercial product or service that incorporates TabNab requires a commercial license.

#### ...I'm a consultant and want to use TabNab for client projects?
**Yes.** Professional services and consulting work require a commercial license.

#### ...I work for a non-profit organization (501(c)(3))?
**No.** Legitimate non-profit organizations can use TabNab under the free license.

#### ...I'm building an open-source project (non-commercial)?
**No.** Open-source projects that don't generate revenue are covered by the free license.

#### ...my startup isn't making money yet?
**Yes.** Once you're operating as a for-profit business entity (even pre-revenue), you need a commercial license. We offer special pricing for early-stage startups.

#### ...I want to contribute to TabNab development?
**No.** Contributors don't need a license to contribute code. However, if your employer requires you to contribute as part of your job, your employer would need a commercial license.

## Technical Questions

### Does the license restrict which features I can use?

No. Both the free and commercial licenses provide access to all TabNab features. The distinction is purely about use case (commercial vs. non-commercial), not feature access.

### Can I modify TabNab's source code?

Yes, both licenses allow you to modify the source code. However:
- **PolyForm Shield**: You can modify for non-commercial purposes
- **Commercial License**: You can modify for commercial purposes

### Can I redistribute TabNab?

- **PolyForm Shield**: Yes, for non-commercial purposes, with proper attribution
- **Commercial License**: Redistribution terms depend on your specific license tier

### Do I need a license for each developer or each deployment?

This depends on the commercial license tier you select. Common models include:
- Per-developer licensing
- Per-deployment licensing
- Per-organization unlimited use

Contact us to discuss which model works best for your use case.

## Pricing and Purchase

### How much does a commercial license cost?

Pricing varies by company size and use case. We offer:
- **Startup tier**: For companies under $1M annual revenue
- **Business tier**: For companies $1M-$10M annual revenue
- **Enterprise tier**: For companies over $10M annual revenue

### Is there a free trial for commercial use?

You can evaluate TabNab under the PolyForm Shield License. For extended commercial trials beyond the evaluation period, please contact us to discuss options.

### What payment methods do you accept?

We accept:
- Credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express)
- ACH/wire transfer (for annual licenses)
- Purchase orders (for enterprise customers)

### Are licenses perpetual or subscription-based?

We offer both models:
- **Annual subscription**: Includes updates and support for one year
- **Perpetual license**: One-time payment with optional maintenance/support renewal

### Can I upgrade my license tier later?

Yes, you can upgrade at any time. We'll prorate any remaining value from your current license.

## Compliance and Enforcement

### How do you enforce the commercial license requirement?

We rely primarily on the honor system and trust our users to comply with the license terms. We may:
- Investigate reported violations
- Request license verification from known commercial users
- Take legal action in cases of willful infringement

### What happens if I violate the license terms?

If we discover unlicensed commercial use, we will:
1. Contact you to discuss the situation
2. Offer a 30-day grace period to come into compliance
3. Work with you to find an appropriate licensing solution

We prefer to resolve issues cooperatively. Legal action is a last resort.

### Can I switch from commercial to non-commercial use?

If your use case changes (e.g., you stop using TabNab commercially), you can stop renewing your commercial license and revert to the free PolyForm Shield License. However, you cannot use it for any commercial purpose during that time.

## Support and Maintenance

### What support is included with the free license?

The free PolyForm Shield License includes:
- Community support via GitHub Issues

### What additional support comes with a commercial license?

- Priority email support with guaranteed response times
- Access to private security advisories
